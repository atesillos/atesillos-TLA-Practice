# TLA+ Practice
## Notes
- Since PlusCal algorithms aren’t syntactically valid TLA+, we can’t run it in a TLA file. Instead, you leave them in comments and let the PlusCal translator translate it.
- Use = to declare variables
- Use := for ____
- Use /= for not equal
- `A:` and `B:` are labels for defining steps in the algorithm. They especially help with keeping track of concurrent algorithms
